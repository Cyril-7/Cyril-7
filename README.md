ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Cyril T Johnson, a multifaceted student passionate about leveraging technology to create impactful solutions.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning and honing my skills in web development, Python programming, app creation, and software development.

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in exploring opportunities as a Full Stack Developer, Website Developer, and Python Developer.

ðŸ’¼ I recently completed an internship at Zee Media Corporation Limited, where I worked on projects involving OCR (Optical Character Recognition) and Fake News Detection in WhatsApp.

ðŸŽ“ I graduated from Christ University, Delhi NCR with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Applications. During my time there, I worked on various projects including an Indoor Navigation System using Augmented Reality (AR) and AI-Generated Imagery using Stable Diffusion models.

ðŸš€ Some of my skills include Data Visualization, OpenAI integration, and developing WhatsApp bots.

ðŸ“« You can reach me via LinkedIn: [Cyril T Johnson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cyril-t-johnson/)

âš¡ Fun fact: I enjoy exploring the intersection of technology and creativity, whether it's through coding projects or experimenting with AI-generated art.
